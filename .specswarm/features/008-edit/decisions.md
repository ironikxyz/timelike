## Decision Key

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| ASSUMED | Assumption made without explicit spec guidance (confidence: high/medium/low) |
| DEFERRED | Decision postponed — noted for later resolution |
| FLAGGED | Judgment call between alternatives — requires review |
| ABSENT | What was NOT done and why — forced reflection on gaps |
| INHERITED | Assumption carried forward from a prior task's output |

---

Run: `/specswarm:implement --dispatch`, specswarm 4.0.1-botbaubble.2.35.0 (`4ff8dcb`). Blocks are run from
the installed `commands/implement.md`, not from the expanded text: this expansion again replaced awk's
`$0` with the command's argument (`--dispatch`) in `scope-tally` and `decision-tally`.
Checklists: requirements.md 16/16 after its FR-12 item was ticked (decided by discovery revision 13).
Pause file path (step 1e): `<repo>/../bridge/dispatch/pause-008.md` (the checkout path quoted as `<repo>/`, P2).
Process slip, corrected before any further commit: this initialising commit was first made without the
deny-list gate and carried the absolute pause path (P2, line 21). It was amended locally (never pushed).
Every later commit goes through the gate in the commit helper.
